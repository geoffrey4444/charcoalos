## `charcoalos`
This repo will hold some code to help me learn about kernels, inspired by tutorials at [OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) and [NAND2Testris](https://www.nand2tetris.org).

Starting from a minimal "hello world" kernel that runs either in [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) virtually or on the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com), I plan to gradually build up code to do kernel-type things (memory, files, hardware, ...).
